									The interaction of machines provides organisations with opportunities to increase efficiencies and to exploit new business opportunities. As a result, building Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems with machine-to-machine (m2m) service providers is important to be able to plan and enable digital business solutions in every sector.
									From vehicle tracking to improve logistics management, security implementation, enriching customer experience in store, and water or electricity meter reading to simply knowing when a vending machine needs to be re-stocked or assuring the right conditions of products along the cold chain; the IoT is changing cities and lives by improving our everyday experiences.</p>
